# Kart JSON Editor

## Overview

Another project, [Kart Elo](https://www.github.com/BenjaminMassey/KartElo) uses JSON files in order
to do ELO calculations for Mario Kart competitions.

This project was made to provide a front-end application to add matches to this JSON file of matches,
as to avoid everyone having to get dirty with the JSON itself.

This is written in Rust using EGUI as the front-end, and standard Serde / Serde-Json functions.
